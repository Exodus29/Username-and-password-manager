# Username-and-password-manager
This program allows the user to create an account with a unique username and password, login into an existing account, and change the password of an existing account. 
Since the program saves all the usernames and passwords to seperate files, this program can be ran again later and still use any previously entered data
**DISCLAIMER**: When trying to change the password of an account. If the username and password files have multiple lines of info, 
the program for some reason will not read the very last line of info.
