# Username-and-password-manager
This program allows the user to create an account with a unique username and password, login into an existing account, and change the password of an existing account. 
**DISCLAIMER**: When trying to change the password of an account. If the username and password files have multiple lines of info, the program for some reason will not read the very last line of info.
